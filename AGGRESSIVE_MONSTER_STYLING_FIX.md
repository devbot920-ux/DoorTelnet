# Fix for Aggressive Monsters Not Showing as Red

## Problem
The UI stopped displaying aggressive monsters in red color, even though the monster disposition was being correctly updated to "aggressive" in the data model.

## Root Cause
The `MonsterDisplay` class in `RoomViewModel.cs` was not implementing `INotifyPropertyChanged`. This meant that when a monster's `Disposition` property changed from "neutral" to "aggressive", the UI data binding system was not notified of the change, so the style triggers that make aggressive monsters red were not firing.

## The Fix
Modified the `MonsterDisplay` class to properly implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added INotifyPropertyChanged Interface**: The `MonsterDisplay` class now implements `INotifyPropertyChanged`

2. **Private Backing Fields**: Converted auto-properties to full properties with private backing fields:
   - `_name`
   - `_disposition` 
   - `_targetingYou`
   - `_count`

3. **Property Change Notifications**: Each property setter now:
   - Checks if the value actually changed
   - Updates the backing field
   - Calls `OnPropertyChanged()` to notify the UI
   - Also notifies dependent properties (e.g., when `Disposition` changes, `IsAggressive` is also notified)

4. **Dependent Property Notifications**: Added proper cascade notifications:
   - When `Name` or `Count` changes ? `DisplayName` is notified
   - When `Disposition` changes ? `IsAggressive` is notified

## How It Works Now

1. **Monster Becomes Aggressive**: Combat system detects monster damage or targeting
2. **Data Update**: `CombatTracker.MarkMonsterAsAggressive()` calls `RoomTracker.UpdateMonsterDisposition()`
3. **Collection Update**: `RoomViewModel.UpdateMonsterCollection()` updates the existing `MonsterDisplay.Disposition` property
4. **UI Notification**: Property setter fires `PropertyChanged` event for `Disposition` and `IsAggressive`
5. **Style Trigger**: WPF DataTrigger `<DataTrigger Binding="{Binding IsAggressive}" Value="True">` activates
6. **Visual Update**: Monster text turns red (`#FFFF0000`) and becomes bold if targeting player

## XAML Style (Already Working)
```xaml
<Style TargetType="TextBlock">
    <Setter Property="Foreground" Value="White" />
    <Style.Triggers>
        <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding IsAggressive}" Value="True">
            <Setter Property="Foreground" Value="#FFFF0000" />
        </DataTrigger>
        <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding TargetingYou}" Value="True">
            <Setter Property="FontWeight" Value="Bold" />
            <Setter Property="Foreground" Value="#FFFF0000" />
        </DataTrigger>
    </Style.Triggers>
</Style>
```

## Result
Aggressive monsters now correctly display in red again when they become aggressive during combat. The styling will update in real-time as monster dispositions change during gameplay.

## Files Modified
- `DoorTelnet.Wpf/ViewModels/RoomViewModel.cs` - Added INotifyPropertyChanged to MonsterDisplay class

This fix ensures that the data binding properly communicates changes from the game logic to the visual presentation layer, restoring the expected red coloring for aggressive monsters.
