# Navigation Input Field Troubleshooting

## Issue: "Cannot type anything into the navigation field"

### Root Cause
The navigation input field was disabled because it was bound to `IsEnabled="{Binding IsNavigationEnabled}"`, which depends on the `AutoNavigation` feature flag in the PlayerProfile being enabled.

By default, `AutoNavigation` was set to `false`, which disabled the entire navigation interface.

### Solution Applied ?

1. **Removed IsEnabled binding from TextBox**:
   - **Before**: `<TextBox ... IsEnabled="{Binding IsNavigationEnabled}"/>`
   - **After**: `<TextBox ... />` (always enabled)

2. **Enabled AutoNavigation by default**:
   ```csharp
   // In DoorTelnet.Core/Player/PlayerProfile.cs
   public class FeatureFlags
   {
       // Navigation feature flags - Enable by default for testing
       public bool AutoNavigation { get; set; } = true;
       public bool AvoidDangerousRooms { get; set; } = true;
       public bool PauseNavigationInCombat { get; set; } = true;
   }
   ```

3. **Improved property change notifications**:
   - Added `INotifyPropertyChanged` to `NavigationFeatureService`
   - Enhanced status update handling in `RoomViewModel`
   - Better UI binding updates

### Current Behavior ?

- **Navigation input field**: Always enabled for typing
- **Navigation buttons**: Enabled/disabled based on navigation availability and state
- **Status display**: Shows real-time navigation status updates
- **Default settings**: Navigation features enabled out of the box

### UI Controls Status

| Control | Enabled When | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Destination TextBox** | Always | User can always type destinations |
| **"Go" Button** | `AutoNavigation=true` AND destination not empty AND not currently navigating | Start immediate navigation |
| **"Stop" Button** | Currently navigating | Stop active navigation |
| **"Set Pending" Button** | `AutoNavigation=true` AND destination not empty | Queue navigation for later |
| **Status Display** | Always | Show current navigation state |

### Testing Steps

1. **? Input Field**: Should accept text input immediately
2. **? Go Button**: Should be enabled when you type a destination
3. **? Status Updates**: Should show "Navigation idle" initially
4. **? Graph Loading**: Check logs for "Navigation graph loaded successfully"

### Troubleshooting Checklist

If navigation input still doesn't work:

#### ? Check Graph Data Loading
```
Look for these log messages on startup:
- "Loading navigation graph data..."
- "Navigation graph loaded successfully: X nodes, Y edges"
- If missing: Ensure graph.json exists in application directory
```

#### ? Check AutoNavigation Setting
```csharp
// Verify in PlayerProfile that AutoNavigation is enabled
Features.AutoNavigation == true
```

#### ? Check UI Binding
```
- NavigationDestination property should update as you type
- IsNavigationEnabled should return true
- Navigation buttons should respond to commands
```

#### ? Check Property Notifications
```csharp
// NavigationFeatureService should implement INotifyPropertyChanged
// RoomViewModel should update when navigation state changes
```

### Error Scenarios

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Graph not loaded** | Buttons disabled, status shows errors | Ensure graph.json exists in app directory |
| **AutoNavigation disabled** | Buttons grayed out | Set `Features.AutoNavigation = true` |
| **Input field disabled** | Cannot type in TextBox | Remove `IsEnabled` binding (fixed) |
| **Commands not working** | Buttons enabled but don't respond | Check command implementations |
| **Status not updating** | Status text never changes | Check event subscriptions |

### Log Messages to Look For

**Successful Startup**:
```
NavigationFeatureService initialized - AutoNavigation: True
Loading navigation graph data...
Navigation graph loaded successfully: 3446 nodes, 7077 edges
```

**Navigation Attempt**:
```
Navigation started to: [destination]
Started navigation from [source] to [target], X steps
```

**Errors**:
```
Graph data file not found: [path]
Could not find room matching '[destination]'
Navigation safety check failed: [reason]
```

### Manual Override

If you need to manually enable navigation features:

```csharp
// In-game or through settings
playerProfile.Features.AutoNavigation = true;
playerProfile.Features.AvoidDangerousRooms = true;
playerProfile.Features.PauseNavigationInCombat = true;
```

The navigation input field should now work properly for Phase 2 testing! ??
