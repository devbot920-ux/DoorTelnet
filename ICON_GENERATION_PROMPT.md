## Icon Design Requirements

### Visual Concepts to Incorporate
1. **Primary Theme**: Medieval fantasy gaming meets modern technology
2. **Key Elements**:
   - **Door/Portal**: Represents "Door" in DoorTelnet (BBS door games)
   - **Terminal/Computer**: Represents the telnet/technical aspect
   - **Fantasy Elements**: Sword, shield, or magical symbols (the app is for RPG games)
   - **Network/Connection**: Subtle indication of networked multiplayer gaming

### Suggested Design Approaches
**Option 1: Medieval Door with Tech**
- A medieval wooden door or stone archway with glowing edges
- Small terminal/computer screen integrated into the door frame
- Subtle network connection lines or WiFi symbols

**Option 2: Shield with Terminal**
- A medieval shield as the primary shape
- Terminal screen or code patterns integrated into the shield surface
- Crossed sword and wand/staff behind the shield

**Option 3: Portal Gateway**
- A mystical portal or gateway with glowing runes
- Digital/matrix-style elements around the edges
- Subtle gaming controller or keyboard keys integrated

### Technical Specifications
