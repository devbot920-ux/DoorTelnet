# Navigation Combat Check Removal

## Overview
Removed combat checks from navigation system to allow navigation during combat, enabling players to escape dangerous situations even when fighting.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Disabled PauseNavigationInCombat Feature Flag**
**File:** `DoorTelnet.Core/Player/PlayerProfile.cs`
```csharp
// BEFORE
public bool PauseNavigationInCombat { get; set; } = true;

// AFTER  
public bool PauseNavigationInCombat { get; set; } = false; // DISABLED: Allow navigation during combat
```

### 2. **Removed Combat Event Subscriptions from NavigationService**
**File:** `DoorTelnet.Core/Navigation/Services/NavigationService.cs`

**Removed Combat Event Handlers:**
```csharp
// REMOVED these subscriptions from constructor:
// _combatTracker.CombatStarted += OnCombatStarted;
// _combatTracker.CombatCompleted += OnCombatCompleted;

// REMOVED these methods entirely:
// private void OnCombatStarted(ActiveCombat combat) { ... }
// private void OnCombatCompleted(CombatEntry combat) { ... }
```

### 3. **Simplified Navigation Safety Checks**
**File:** `DoorTelnet.Core/Navigation/Services/NavigationService.cs`

**Removed Combat Check from IsSafeToNavigate:**
```csharp
private bool IsSafeToNavigate(out string reason)
{
    reason = string.Empty;

    // Check health (kept)
    if (_statsTracker != null)
    {
        var hpPercent = _statsTracker.Hp / (double)Math.Max(_statsTracker.MaxHp, 1) * 100;
        if (hpPercent < _playerProfile.Thresholds.NavigationMinHpPercent)
        {
            reason = $"Health too low: {hpPercent:F1}% (minimum: {_playerProfile.Thresholds.NavigationMinHpPercent}%)";
            return false;
        }
    }

    // REMOVED: Combat state check - navigation now allowed during combat
    // This allows players to navigate away from danger even when in combat

    return true;
}
```

### 4. **Updated NavigationFeatureService Safety Logic**
**File:** `DoorTelnet.Wpf/Services/NavigationFeatureService.cs`

**Removed Combat Check from IsSafeToStartNavigation:**
```csharp
private bool IsSafeToStartNavigation()
{
    // Check health (kept)
    if (_statsTracker != null)
    {
        var hpPercent = _statsTracker.Hp / (double)Math.Max(_statsTracker.MaxHp, 1) * 100;
        if (hpPercent < _playerProfile.Thresholds.NavigationMinHpPercent)
        {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // REMOVED: Combat state check - navigation now allowed during combat
    // This allows players to navigate away from danger even when in combat

    return true;
}
```

### 5. **Stop Button Functionality Verified**
**File:** `DoorTelnet.Wpf/ViewModels/RoomViewModel.cs`

The Stop button was already working correctly:
- **StopNavigationCommand** properly bound to UI
- **CanStopNavigation()** method correctly checks navigation state
- **StopNavigation()** method calls service and updates UI
- Command state properly refreshed when navigation status changes

## What This Accomplishes

### ? **Combat Check Removal**
- **Navigation starts immediately** regardless of combat state
- **No pausing** when combat begins during navigation  
- **No waiting** for combat to end before resuming navigation
- **Players can escape danger** by navigating away even during combat

### ? **Stop Button Functionality**
- **Stop button works reliably** to cancel active navigation
- **Button enabled/disabled** based on navigation state
- **UI updates immediately** when navigation is stopped
- **Dropdown closes** when navigation is stopped

### ? **Safety Considerations**
- **Health check still active** - won't navigate if HP too low
- **Path safety validation** still works for dangerous rooms
- **Room detection timeout** still prevents stuck navigation
- **Manual stop always available** via Stop button

## User Experience Improvements

### **Before Changes:**
- ? Navigation blocked if player in combat
- ? Navigation paused automatically when combat started
- ? Had to wait for combat to end before navigation resumed
- ? Couldn't escape dangerous situations via navigation

### **After Changes:**
- ? Navigation works regardless of combat state
- ? Players can navigate away from danger immediately
- ? Stop button always works to cancel navigation  
- ? No automatic pausing due to combat
- ? Health-based safety checks still protect players

## Technical Benefits

### **Simplified Navigation Logic:**
- Fewer event subscriptions and handlers
- Less complex state management
- Reduced coupling between combat and navigation systems
- More predictable navigation behavior

### **Better Emergency Navigation:**
- Players can flee dangerous areas during combat
- Navigation works in all situations except low health
- Stop button provides reliable manual override
- No mysterious automatic pauses due to combat

## Files Modified
1. `DoorTelnet.Core/Player/PlayerProfile.cs` - Disabled PauseNavigationInCombat flag
2. `DoorTelnet.Core/Navigation/Services/NavigationService.cs` - Removed combat event handlers and checks
3. `DoorTelnet.Wpf/Services/NavigationFeatureService.cs` - Removed combat safety check

## Result
Navigation now works seamlessly without combat interference, while the Stop button provides reliable manual control. Players can navigate to safety even when under attack, making the navigation system much more useful in dangerous situations.
