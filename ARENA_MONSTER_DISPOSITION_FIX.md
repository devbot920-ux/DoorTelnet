# Arena Monster Disposition Fix

## Issue
When using any command that refreshes room information in an Arena (including "look" commands, pressing Enter, or any room refresh), the system was incorrectly resetting monster dispositions from "aggressive" back to "neutral". This caused the automation system to lose track of which monsters were hostile.

## Root Cause
Both `TryParseLookCommand` and `ParseRoomFromBuffer` methods in `RoomModels.cs` were creating completely new room states when parsing room data. The `RoomParser.Parse()` method defaults all monsters to "neutral" disposition, which overwrote any existing knowledge that monsters were aggressive.

### Code Flow Problem:
1. **Gong rings** ? Monster summoned as "aggressive" in current room
2. **Player presses Enter or types "look"** ? Room parsing methods process the output  
3. **RoomParser.Parse()** ? Creates new room state with all monsters as "neutral"
4. **Monster disposition lost** ? Automation stops attacking

## Solution Implemented

### **Enhanced Both Room Parsing Methods**
**File:** `DoorTelnet.Core/World/RoomModels.cs`

**Key Changes:**

#### 1. **TryParseLookCommand - Preserve Remote Room Monster Data**
```csharp
// CRITICAL FIX: Preserve existing monster disposition information
// Check if we have existing information about this room
var adjKey = MakeKey(user, character, parsed.Name);
if (_rooms.ContainsKey(adjKey))
{
    var existingRoom = _rooms[adjKey];
    
    // Merge monster disposition information from existing room data
    var mergedMonsters = new List<MonsterInfo>();
    foreach (var newMonster in parsed.Monsters)
    {
        // Look for existing monster with same name
        var existingMonster = existingRoom.Monsters.FirstOrDefault(m => 
            string.Equals(m.Name, newMonster.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
            string.Equals(m.Name?.Replace(" (summoned)", ""), newMonster.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
        
        if (existingMonster != null)
        {
            // Preserve the existing disposition and targeting info
            mergedMonsters.Add(new MonsterInfo(
                newMonster.Name, 
                existingMonster.Disposition, // Keep existing disposition (aggressive/neutral)
                existingMonster.TargetingYou, // Keep existing targeting status
                newMonster.Count));
        }
        else
        {
            // New monster, use default neutral disposition
            mergedMonsters.Add(newMonster);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. **ParseRoomFromBuffer - Preserve Current Room Monster Data**
```csharp
// CRITICAL FIX: Preserve existing monster disposition information for current room refreshes
// This handles cases like pressing Enter to refresh the room, which should not reset aggressive monsters
if (CurrentRoom != null && string.Equals(state.Name, CurrentRoom.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
{
    // Merge monster disposition information from current room
    var mergedMonsters = new List<MonsterInfo>();
    foreach (var newMonster in state.Monsters)
    {
        // Look for existing monster with same name
        var existingMonster = CurrentRoom.Monsters.FirstOrDefault(m => 
            string.Equals(m.Name, newMonster.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ||
            string.Equals(m.Name?.Replace(" (summoned)", ""), newMonster.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
        
        if (existingMonster != null)
        {
            // Preserve the existing disposition and targeting info
            mergedMonsters.Add(new MonsterInfo(
                newMonster.Name, 
                existingMonster.Disposition, // Keep existing disposition (aggressive/neutral)
                existingMonster.TargetingYou, // Keep existing targeting status
                newMonster.Count));
        }
        else
        {
            // New monster not seen before, use default neutral disposition
            mergedMonsters.Add(newMonster);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. **Cross-Room Monster Tracking**
```csharp
// Also check for monsters that exist in our current room but not in the look result
// (they might have moved to the adjacent room)
foreach (var currentMonster in CurrentRoom.Monsters)
{
    // If this monster is not in the look result but was aggressive, track it
    if (!mergedMonsters.Any(m => string.Equals(m.Name, currentMonster.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) &&
        currentMonster.Disposition.Equals("aggressive", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        // Monster may have moved to the adjacent room - add it with aggressive disposition
        mergedMonsters.Add(new MonsterInfo(
            currentMonster.Name,
            currentMonster.Disposition,
            currentMonster.TargetingYou,
            currentMonster.Count));
    }
}
```

## How The Fix Works

### **Before Fix:**
1. ? Ring gong ? Monster summoned as "aggressive"
2. ? Press Enter OR type "look" ? Monster disposition reset to "neutral"
3. ? AutoGong stops attacking ? Player confused

### **After Fix:**
1. ? Ring gong ? Monster summoned as "aggressive" 
2. ? Press Enter OR type "look" ? Monster disposition **preserved** as "aggressive"
3. ? AutoGong continues attacking ? Automation works correctly

## Technical Benefits

### **Comprehensive Coverage:**
- **Handles Enter key** - Room refreshes preserve monster state
- **Handles look commands** - Remote room viewing preserves state
- **Handles any room parsing** - Both methods now preserve disposition
- **Maintains combat context** across all room updates

### **Smart Disposition Merging:**
- **Preserves aggressive state** when monsters are still hostile
- **Maintains targeting information** for ongoing combat
- **Handles monster movement** between rooms intelligently
- **Defaults safely** to neutral for truly new monsters

### **Cross-Room Intelligence:**
- **Tracks monsters that move** from current room to adjacent rooms
- **Maintains combat context** across room boundaries  
- **Prevents disposition loss** during room transitions
- **Supports multi-room combat scenarios**

### **Backward Compatibility:**
- **No changes to existing APIs** - works transparently
- **Preserves all other functionality** - items, exits, etc.
- **Safe fallback behavior** for unknown monsters
- **Debug logging** for troubleshooting

## Arena Combat Scenarios Fixed

### **Scenario 1: Basic Room Refresh (Enter Key)**
```
> ring gong
A demon is summoned for combat!
[Monster marked as aggressive ?]

> [Press Enter]
You see: A demon is here.
[Monster stays aggressive ? - Previously would reset to neutral ?]
```

### **Scenario 2: Look Command**
```
> ring gong
A demon is summoned for combat!
[Monster marked as aggressive ?]

> look
You see: A demon is here.
[Monster stays aggressive ? - Previously would reset to neutral ?]
```

### **Scenario 3: Monster Movement**
```
> ring gong  
A demon is summoned for combat!
[Demon aggressive in current room ?]

> look east
You see: A demon is here.
[Demon preserved as aggressive in adjacent room ?]
```

### **Scenario 4: Multiple Room Operations**
```
> ring gong
A demon is summoned for combat!
[Demon aggressive ?]

> [Press Enter]
> look
> [Press Enter]
[Demon stays aggressive through all operations ?]
```

## Impact on AutoGong

### **Reliable Combat Automation:**
- **Continues attacking** after ANY room refresh
- **Works with Enter key** - most common refresh method
- **Works with look commands** - for checking adjacent rooms
- **Tracks monsters accurately** across all scenarios
- **Maintains combat state** during any exploration

### **User Experience:**
- **No more mysterious stops** when refreshing rooms
- **Predictable automation behavior** regardless of input method
- **Seamless combat flow** during any room interaction
- **Reduced manual intervention** needed
- **Works consistently** with all room update methods

## Files Modified
1. `DoorTelnet.Core/World/RoomModels.cs` - Enhanced both `TryParseLookCommand` and `ParseRoomFromBuffer` methods

## Result
Monster dispositions are now properly preserved during ANY room refresh operation in arenas. Whether you press Enter, use look commands, or any other room update method, AutoGong and AutoAttack continue working correctly, providing a completely reliable automation experience.
