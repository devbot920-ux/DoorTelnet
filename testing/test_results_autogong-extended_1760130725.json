  },
  "llm_analysis": "## Root Cause\n\nThe failure is a state synchronization/parsing race between the automation feature, the combat tracker, the room tracker, and the telnet send/response path:\n\n- The client issues \"autoattack on\" but the AutomationFeatureService never flips its internal flag or the parser that would confirm the server response doesn't detect/propagate the confirmation. That makes the UI/automation show autoAttack: false even after the command was issued.\n- CombatTracker still has targetedMonster = \"orc\" / inCombat = true while RoomTracker reports no monsters. That indicates the \"combat end\" output from the server either was parsed by the RoomTracker (clearing monsters) but not by the CombatTracker (or the CombatTracker didn't react because of a timing/ordering issue), leaving trackers in inconsistent states.\n- The combination of these problems leads to ambiguous \"in combat\" state with no monsters present, and auto-attack remaining disabled (so automation will not automatically re-engage). In short: missing/fragile parsing + no optimistic local update + lack of cross-tracker reconciliation causes stuck state.\n\nLikely contributing technical causes:\n- Output parsing is incomplete or brittle (missing regexes for server messages that indicate autoattack on/off and combat disengaged), or those parser handlers are not wired to AutomationFeatureService/CombatTracker.\n- AutomationFeatureService does not optimistically set its state when sending a toggle command (or does not reconcile on timeout/failure).\n- CombatTracker doesn't respond to RoomTracker events (monsters list empty) to clear combat state or runs into race conditions (order of parser callbacks).\n- TelnetClient/command queue could swallow or delay the \"autoattack on\" command or the parser could process the confirmation after a different tracker has already changed state, leaving inconsistent state.\n\n## Files to Check\n\n- AutomationFeatureService.cs: responsible for toggling and reporting autoAttack. Needs to optimistically update state, register parser confirmations, handle timeouts/retries, and raise property changed events.\n\n- GameOutputParser.cs (or whatever file implements parsing of server lines; e.g., OutputParser.cs, TextParser.cs, or ServerMessageParser.cs): add/verify patterns for \"auto attack on/off\", \"you begin auto-attacking\", \"you stop attacking\", \"combat disengaged\", \"You are no longer engaged\" etc., and ensure these lines invoke the correct methods on AutomationFeatureService and CombatTracker.\n\n- CombatTracker.cs: ensure it listens to both parsed \"combat end\" messages and RoomTracker.Monsters changes; when monsters list becomes empty, reconcile and clear targetedMonster/inCombat after a small debounce; avoid leaving target set when there are no monsters.\n\n- RoomTracker.cs: ensure it raises events (MonstersChanged or RoomCleared) when monster list goes to zero; make sure event order is reliable and documented (e.g., parser should update RoomTracker then CombatTracker should react).\n\n- TelnetClient.cs / CommandSender.cs: ensure SendCommand actually transmits commands immediately (newline-terminated), doesn't suppress or reorder commands while in combat, and raises an event when a command is queued/sent so higher layers can reconcile optimistic state. Also ensure server responses are delivered to the parser without being filtered.\n\n- (Optional) GameApiService.cs or AutomationFeatureFacade.cs: if there is a fa\u00e7ade used to issue automation commands, check that it's correctly calling TelnetClient.SendCommand and waiting for confirmation/pushing state changes.\n\n## GitHub Copilot Prompt\n\n```\nRepository: DoorTelnet (C# .NET 8 WPF)\nGoal: Fix auto-attack toggle and combat/room state desync so automation reliably enables auto-attack and trackers stay consistent.\n\nBackground:\n- AutomationFeatureService holds an autoAttack boolean used by automation. Users send \"autoattack on\" via telnet.\n- Output parsing currently doesn't always flip AutomationFeatureService.autoAttack when server confirms, leaving autoAttack false even after issuing the command.\n- CombatTracker can end up with targetedMonster != null while RoomTracker.Monsters is empty. Parser emits \"Combat disengaged\" text and RoomTracker clears monsters, but CombatTracker stays in combat.\n- TelnetClient.SendCommand must reliably send \"autoattack on\" and not be silently dropped or delayed.\n\nTasks (implement the following changes & tests):\n\n1) AutomationFeatureService.cs\n- Add an optimistic state update when toggling auto-attack:\n  - public Task SetAutoAttackAsync(bool enabled)\n    - Immediately set private _autoAttack = enabled and raise PropertyChanged/OnAutoAttackChanged so UI and automation see new state.\n    - Fire TelnetClient.SendCommand($\"autoattack {(enabled ? \"on\" : \"off\")}\");\n    - Start a short confirmation timeout (e.g., 2-4s). If no parser-confirmation sets the state to the expected value within timeout, re-send the command once and log a warning.\n    - Provide a method ApplyAutoAttackConfirmed(bool confirmed) called by the output parser to mark the state authoritative.\n- Ensure thread-safety (use a lock or Interlocked) and preserve last-known server-confirmed state.\n\nAdd or modify events:\n- public event Action<bool> AutoAttackStateChanged; // raised on optimistic change and on confirmed change\n\n2) OutputParser.cs (or file that handles server text)\n- Add regexes and handlers for common server messages indicating auto-attack on/off, for example:\n  - Patterns to match: \n    - @\"\\bauto-?attack(?:ing)?\\b.*\\bon\\b\" or \"You begin auto-attacking\" => AutomationFeatureService.ApplyAutoAttackConfirmed(true)\n    - @\"\\bauto-?attack(?:ing)?\\b.*\\boff\\b\" or \"You stop auto-attacking\" => AutomationFeatureService.ApplyAutoAttackConfirmed(false)\n- Add regex for combat end/disengaged lines:\n  - Examples: \"Combat disengaged\", \"You are no longer engaged in combat\", \"You disengage\" => call CombatTracker.EndCombat(reason)\n- When detecting a \"combat end\" line, call CombatTracker.EndCombat() and RoomTracker should already be updated by other parser rules. If not present, clear targetedMonster and set InCombat = false.\n\n3) CombatTracker.cs\n- Add a listener for RoomTracker.MonstersUpdated or event when RoomTracker.Monsters.Count == 0:\n  - When RoomTracker reports zero monsters and CombatTracker.InCombat is true and TargetedMonster != null:\n    - Use a short debounce (e.g., 250-500ms) to avoid flipping during transient parser ordering.\n    - Then clear TargetedMonster (set to null) and set InCombat=false; raise events so other components are notified.\n- Add EndCombat() method called by parser when detecting explicit \"combat disengaged\" lines; ensure it clears state and cancels any internal timers.\n\n4) RoomTracker.cs\n- Ensure it raises a MonstersChanged event when the monsters collection becomes empty. Make event payload include timestamp and Count.\n- Ensure update ordering is stable: parser should update RoomTracker first then call combat-related handlers (or vice versa) but both trackers should be able to reconcile at event time.\n\n5) TelnetClient.cs\n- Ensure SendCommand(string cmd) immediately writes the command with proper newline and flushes the stream.\n- Expose an event CommandSent(string command) so AutomationFeatureService can optimistically assume the command was dispatched. Return Task/ack that completes after write.\n- Ensure the client does not block sending normal commands during combat text parsing.\n\n6) Logging and diagnostics\n- Add debug logs for:\n  - AutomationFeatureService: optimistic set, confirmed set, timeout + retry.\n  - Parser: lines matched for autoattack and combat end.\n  - CombatTracker: when clearing target due to empty room.\n- Add a debug-only diagnostic that dumps: (autoAttack flag, CombatTracker.InCombat, CombatTracker.TargetedMonster, RoomTracker.MonsterCount) whenever an auto-attack toggle fails to confirm.\n\n7) Unit/integration tests\n- Add tests simulating:\n  - Send SetAutoAttackAsync(true) -> simulate server line \"You begin auto-attacking\" -> assert AutomationFeatureService.AutoAttack == true and ApplyAutoAttackConfirmed called.\n  - Send SetAutoAttackAsync(true) -> no server ack; ensure optimistic state is true, and after timeout and ephemeral re-send the state remains true or logs warning.\n  - Simulate parser sequence where RoomTracker gets Monsters cleared before CombatTracker receives \"combat end\" -> CombatTracker clears target after debounce.\n  - Simulate \"Combat disengaged\" text and assert both RoomTracker.Monsters==0 and CombatTracker.InCombat==false.\n\nImplementation hints & signatures (adjust to your actual class/method names):\n- AutomationFeatureService.cs\n  - private volatile bool _autoAttack;\n  - public bool AutoAttack => _autoAttack;\n  - public async Task SetAutoAttackAsync(bool enabled)\n  - public void ApplyAutoAttackConfirmed(bool enabled) // called by OutputParser\n\n- OutputParser.cs\n  - private void HandleLine(string line)\n    - if (Regex.IsMatch(line, @\"\\bauto-?attack\\b.*\\bon\\b\", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)) automationService.ApplyAutoAttackConfirmed(true);\n    - if (Regex.IsMatch(line, @\"\\bauto-?attack\\b.*\\boff\\b\", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)) automationService.ApplyAutoAttackConfirmed(false);\n    - if (Regex.IsMatch(line, @\"combat disengage|you are no longer engaged|you disengage\", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)) combatTracker.EndCombat();\n\n- CombatTracker.cs\n  - public void EndCombat()\n    - Cancel timers, _targetedMonster = null, InCombat=false, raise events\n  - Subscribe to RoomTracker.MonstersChanged -> if Count == 0 and InCombat then DebounceClearCombat()\n\n- TelnetClient.cs\n  - public Task SendCommand(string cmd)\n    - write cmd + \"\\r\\n\", flush; raise CommandSent event; return completed Task when flushed.\n\nNotes:\n- Add small debounce windows when reacting to room emptiness to prevent races caused by parser order. Keep them short (200-500ms).\n- Be conservative about automatically re-enabling auto-attack: optimistic local state is fine, but the authoritative state should be driven by server confirmations. Use retries/timeouts to self-heal.\n- Add extra unit tests for the exact output lines your game server emits; adjust regexes accordingly.\n\nPlease implement changes in the files:\n- DoorTelnet.Core/Services/AutomationFeatureService.cs\n- DoorTelnet.Core/Parsing/GameOutputParser.cs (or relevant parser file)\n- DoorTelnet.Core/Trackers/CombatTracker.cs\n- DoorTelnet.Core/Trackers/RoomTracker.cs\n- DoorTelnet.Core/Networking/TelnetClient.cs\n\nAdd/modify unit tests in DoorTelnet.Core.Tests for the scenarios above.\n\nEnd of prompt.\n```"
