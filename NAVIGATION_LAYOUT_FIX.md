# Navigation Layout Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
The "Find Stores" and "Set Pending" buttons in the navigation area were overlapping with the travel status text messages, making the interface difficult to read and use.

## Changes Made

### 1. Grid Structure Enhancement
- **Added an additional row** to the navigation Grid (changed from 5 rows to 6 rows)
- This provides better separation between the action buttons and status display

### 2. Improved Spacing
- **Quick actions row (Find Stores/Set Pending buttons)**:
  - Changed margin from `Margin="0 2"` to `Margin="0 4 0 8"`
  - Added more bottom margin (8px) to create clear separation from status text

### 3. Status Display Improvements
- **Moved status text to dedicated Grid.Row="5"**
- **Added visual container**: Wrapped the status text in a Border with:
  - Background: `#2a2a2a` (subtle dark background)
  - Border: `#444` color with 1px thickness
  - Corner radius: 3px for rounded corners
  - Padding: `6,4` for better text spacing
  - Top margin: `4px` for separation from buttons above

### 4. Enhanced Visual Hierarchy
- **Status text styling**:
  - Changed foreground color from `#888` to `#AAA` for better contrast
  - Maintained font size at 10px
  - Kept text wrapping enabled for longer status messages

## Result
- **Clear separation** between action buttons and status messages
- **Better visual hierarchy** with the status text now contained in a subtle background box
- **Improved readability** - no more overlapping text
- **Professional appearance** - the status area now has a dedicated, styled container

## Layout Structure (After Fix)
```
Grid Row 0: Movement Mode Label
Grid Row 1: Movement Mode ComboBox
Grid Row 2: Quick Mode Buttons (Ultra/Fast/Safe)
Grid Row 3: Navigation Input + Go/Stop Buttons
Grid Row 4: Quick Actions (Find Stores/Set Pending) ? Fixed spacing
Grid Row 5: Status Display ? Now in separate bordered container
```

The navigation area now provides a clean, well-organized interface where all elements have proper spacing and the travel status is clearly visible in its own dedicated area.
